## Your Security Matters

BuddyDrive is designed around a simple principle: you should understand exactly what is protected today, and what still depends on trusting your buddy.

## What Exists Today

BuddyDrive currently has these security layers:

| Component | Algorithm | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Direct peer transport | libp2p Noise | Encrypt direct libp2p connections |
| Folder content encryption | libsodium `crypto_secretbox` (XSalsa20-Poly1305) | Encrypt filenames and file contents stored on buddy's machine |
| Path encryption | Deterministic nonce from folderKey + path | Same path always encrypts to same ciphertext (enables move detection) |
| Chunk encryption | Random nonce per 64KB chunk | Prevents nonce reuse across file versions |
| Recovery config backup | libsodium `crypto_secretbox` | Encrypt config synced to relay |
| Pairing code | Shared secret | Match buddies, derive discovery keys, HMAC-authenticate relay records, and relay fallback sessions |
| Recovery phrase | 12-word mnemonic | Re-derive recovery metadata on a new machine |

## Recovery Phrase And Master Key

When you run `buddydrive setup-recovery`:

1. BuddyDrive generates a 12-word recovery phrase
2. It derives a master key from that phrase
3. It stores recovery metadata in `config.toml`
4. It encrypts your serialized config before syncing it to the relay

When you later run `buddydrive recover`, BuddyDrive uses the same 12 words to derive the same recovery material, fetches the encrypted config from the relay, decrypts it locally, and writes the restored config.

## Control API Access

The control API binds to all interfaces (default port 17521):

- **Localhost** (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`): No authentication required
- **LAN**: Requests must use a secret path prefix `/w/<secret>/` derived from your buddy UUID (first 8 hex characters). Requests without the correct secret receive 403 Forbidden

The secret provides basic protection but is low-entropy (32 bits). Only access the web GUI on trusted networks or over localhost.

## Pairing And Direct Connections

The pairing code is a shared secret between buddies:

- You share it out-of-band with someone you trust
- Both sides store it for that buddy relationship
- Relay fallback uses it to match the two peers
- Direct libp2p connections use Noise transport encryption once connected

## Current Scope And Limits

- Direct libp2p transport is encrypted by Noise
- Folder contents (filenames and file data) are encrypted with XSalsa20-Poly1305 before being stored on the buddy's machine when `encrypted = true` (the default)
- Recovery config blobs synced to the relay are encrypted with the recovery master key
- Restore works by recovering config first and then letting normal sync recreate missing files
- Restored files are hash-verified after write
- Append-only protects existing local files from remote overwrite

When `encrypted = false` (sharing mode), files are stored plaintext on the buddy's machine. Pair only with buddies you trust for unencrypted folders.

## What Your Buddy Can See Today

When folder encryption is enabled (default):

Your buddy **cannot** see:
- Your original filenames (encrypted with deterministic path encryption)
- Your file contents (encrypted with random nonces per chunk)
- The encrypted recovery config stored in the relay without your recovery phrase
- Your other buddies' configuration unless you share it with them

Your buddy **can** see:
- The total storage use and sync timing
- The size of encrypted blobs on disk

When folder encryption is disabled (`encrypted = false`):
- Your buddy can see folder and file names, and read file contents

## Threat Model

### What We Protect Against

**Network interception on direct libp2p connections**: Noise protects direct peer transport.

**Relay compromise for config backup**: the relay stores an encrypted config blob; without the recovery phrase-derived master key it should not be readable.

**Lost machine**: recovery lets you rebuild config on a replacement device and then resync missing files.

### What We Do Not Protect Against

**Untrusted buddies with unencrypted folders**: if you pair with someone you do not trust and use `encrypted = false`, they can read your synced files.

**Your machine compromised**: malware on your machine can read files before or during sync.

**Denial of service**: an attacker can still prevent peers from connecting.

## Secure Pairing Guidelines

Only pair with people you trust:

1. Share codes verbally or in person when possible
2. Verify identity through a second channel
3. Use unique codes for each buddy relationship
4. Check buddy IDs on both machines

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Pair only with trusted buddies
- [ ] Verify buddy ID after pairing
- [ ] Write down the 12-word recovery phrase and store it offline
- [ ] Keep your system updated
- [ ] Use strong local passwords
- [ ] Consider full-disk encryption on your machine
- [ ] Regularly check sync activity

## Bottom Line

BuddyDrive protects direct libp2p transport with Noise, encrypts relay-backed recovery config with your master key, and encrypts folder filenames and contents with XSalsa20-Poly1305 before storing them on your buddy's machine. Your buddy sees only opaque encrypted blobs. Set `encrypted = false` only for active collaboration with buddies you trust.
