## Architecture

BuddyDrive uses peer-to-peer networking, relay fallback, and relay-backed config recovery.

## Components

### Daemon

The daemon runs in the foreground today and contains:

- **libp2p node** - direct transport
- **Discovery service** - relay KV-store buddy lookup
- **Sync manager** - folder scan and sync orchestration
- **Control API** - localhost HTTP API for the GUI
- **SQLite state** - runtime status and file index tracking

### GUI

The GTK4 app shows:

- Buddy connection state
- Folder sync status
- Folder and buddy configuration
- Pairing and control actions

### CLI

The CLI handles:

- Initial setup
- Pairing
- Relay configuration
- Recovery setup and restore
- Manual inspection of config, folders, buddies, and logs

## Networking

### libp2p Stack

BuddyDrive uses libp2p for direct peer communication:

| Layer | Protocol | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Transport | TCP | Direct connection |
| Security | Noise | Direct transport encryption |
| Muxer | Yamux | Multiplexing |
| Discovery | Relay KV-store | Find buddy addresses via pairing-code-derived keys |

### Peer Discovery

How two buddies find each other:

1. Each daemon publishes its address record to the relay at `/discovery/<derived-key>`, where the key is derived from the pairing code
2. The daemon looks up configured buddies using the same derived key via the relay KV-store (every 10 minutes)
3. It reads the peer ID and advertised multiaddrs from the record
4. It dials a public TCP address directly, or falls back to a relay when configured
5. Cached addresses in `state.db` allow reconnection when the relay is temporarily unavailable

### NAT Traversal

Current connectivity options:

- **Public TCP address** - direct connection when `announce_addr` points to a reachable public address
- **UPnP** - automatic port forwarding attempt when no explicit `announce_addr` is set
- **Relay fallback** - used when `relay_region` is set and both sides store the same buddy `pairing_code`
- **Deterministic initiator** - the side without a public address initiates; if both same reachability, lower buddy UUID initiates
- **Always accept incoming** - incoming connections from known buddies are accepted regardless of sync time

## File Sync

### Change Detection

The sync manager monitors configured folders:

1. Scan files in the folder using streaming blake2b hash (64KB chunks, never full file in memory)
2. Capture path, encrypted path, size, mtime, content hash, mode, and symlink target
3. Compare against the previous index
4. Detect added, modified, deleted, and moved files (move detection via content hash matching)

### Transfer Protocol

File transfer uses a chunked protocol with encryption:

```text
File list exchange → Delta computation (moves, deletes, missing) → Chunked transfer → Hash verification
```

Chunks are sent in 64KB blocks. LZ4 compression is used when it helps. When folder encryption is enabled, chunks are encrypted with random nonces (XChaCha20-Poly1305). Paths are encrypted with deterministic nonces so the same filename always encrypts the same way.

Restored files are hash-verified after write.

### Restore Behavior

Restore is just sync in the opposite direction:

1. One side advertises a file in its folder list
2. The other side sees the file is missing locally
3. The sync session requests the missing file
4. The file is recreated locally

If the destination folder is append-only and already has a file with that name, the local file is kept.

### SQLite State

BuddyDrive keeps runtime and file state in SQLite under `~/.buddydrive/`.

## Recovery Flow

### Setup Recovery

1. `buddydrive setup-recovery` generates a 12-word phrase
2. BuddyDrive derives a 32-byte master key from the phrase
3. Recovery metadata is stored in `[recovery]` in `config.toml`
4. The serialized config is encrypted with the master key and uploaded to the relay

### Recover On A New Machine

1. `buddydrive recover` asks for the 12-word phrase
2. BuddyDrive derives the same master key again
3. It fetches the encrypted config blob from the relay
4. The config is decrypted and saved locally
5. Starting the daemon lets normal sync restore missing files

## Control API

Local HTTP server (default port 17521) for GUI communication:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| GET /status | Runtime status |
| GET /buddies | Buddy list with connection state |
| GET /folders | Folder list with sync status |
| GET /config | Current saved configuration |
| POST /folders | Add folder |
| DELETE /folders/:name | Remove folder |
| POST /buddies/pair | Pair buddy through the local API |
| POST /buddies/pairing-code | Generate pairing code |
| POST /sync/:folder | Trigger sync |
| POST /config | Update selected config fields |
| POST /config/reload | Reload config from disk |

## Limitations

### Current

- Sync uses deterministic initiator selection (CGNAT-correct)
- One buddy per folder today
- Buddy-backed config fetch for `recover` is not implemented yet (relay path works)
- No delta sync for large files (partial-chunk diffs)
- No selective download

### Planned

- Better background daemon management
- Multiple buddies per folder
- Delta sync (rolling hash for partial-chunk diffs)
- Connection upgrade (replace relay with direct when possible)
- Long-lived CGNAT connections (keepalive)
- Buddy-backed config fetch for recovery
