### Current CLI Limitations

- `buddydrive init --with-recovery` is shown in help but not implemented; use `init` then `setup-recovery` separately
- `buddydrive start --daemon` currently prints a note and continues in the foreground
- `buddydrive stop` is not implemented yet; use your process manager or `Ctrl+C`
- `buddydrive status` does not yet query the running daemon for live connection state
- `buddydrive connect` does not perform a manual direct dial yet
- `buddydrive recover` currently restores configuration from the relay path; the buddy fallback prompt is present, but that fetch path is not implemented yet
- `buddydrive export-recovery` does not reveal the original 12-word phrase because the phrase is not stored locally

## Concepts

### Buddy Identity

When you run `buddydrive init`, your instance gets:

- **Buddy ID** — a UUID that uniquely identifies your BuddyDrive instance
- **Buddy Name** — a human-readable name (adjective-noun format like "purple-banana") displayed in outputs and shared during handshake

### Pairing

To sync folders with someone, both sides add each other:

1. Generate a pairing code with `buddydrive add-buddy --generate-code`
2. Share your Buddy ID and pairing code with your buddy
3. Your buddy runs `buddydrive add-buddy --id <your-id> --code <pairing-code>`
4. Repeat in reverse on the other side

The pairing code serves two purposes:

- Confirms you are pairing with the right person
- Acts as the shared secret for relay fallback

### Recovery and Restore

BuddyDrive can store enough encrypted config in the relay to rebuild a machine later:

1. Run `buddydrive setup-recovery`
2. Write down the generated 12-word recovery phrase
3. BuddyDrive derives a master key, saves recovery metadata in `config.toml`, and syncs an encrypted config blob to the relay
4. On a replacement machine, run `buddydrive recover`, enter the same 12 words, then start the daemon to resync folders

Restore happens in two layers:

- **Config restore** — `buddydrive recover` fetches your encrypted config from the relay and writes `~/.buddydrive/config.toml`
- **File restore** — once the daemon is running again, normal sync recreates missing local files from your buddy

Append-only folders still protect existing local files from being overwritten by the remote copy.

### Folder Policies

- **Encrypted** — folder encryption flag (default true). When enabled, filenames and content are encrypted before being stored on the buddy's machine. Path encryption uses deterministic nonces (same path always encrypts the same way, enabling move detection). Content encryption uses random nonces per chunk (prevents nonce reuse across versions).
- **Append-only** — prevents remote overwrites of existing local files. Missing files are still created
- **Buddy-specific** — restrict a folder to sync with a specific buddy

### Per-Buddy Sync Time

Each buddy can have an optional sync time that controls when to initiate a connection. Incoming connections from known buddies are always accepted regardless of sync time.

```bash
buddydrive config set buddy-sync-time <buddy-id> 03:00
```

When sync time is empty (default), the daemon initiates connections whenever it discovers a buddy address. When set to a time like `03:00`, the daemon only initiates within a 15-minute tolerance window around that time.

## How It Works

### Peer Discovery

1. `buddydrive init` creates a local buddy identity and config file
2. `buddydrive start` creates the libp2p node for the running session
3. The daemon publishes your address to the relay at `/discovery/<derived-key>`, where the key is derived from the pairing code. The record includes peerId, addresses, `isPubliclyReachable`, sync time, and relay region
4. The daemon looks up configured buddies using the same derived key via the relay API (every 10 minutes)
5. Deterministic initiator selection: the side without a public address initiates; if both are the same reachability, the lower buddy UUID initiates
6. It connects directly when a public TCP address is available, or via relay fallback when configured
7. Cached addresses in `state.db` are used for graceful degradation when the relay is unavailable

### Recovery and Transport Security

- Direct libp2p connections use Noise transport encryption
- Recovery setup derives a 32-byte master key from the 12-word phrase
- Config sync encrypts the serialized config blob with the master key before uploading it to the relay API
- Normal sync restores missing files by comparing remote file lists with the local folder state

### Sync Protocol

1. Scans folder for changes (polling-based) using streaming blake2b hash
2. Detects added, modified, deleted, and moved files (move detection via content hash matching)
3. Exchanges file lists with buddy (includes encrypted paths and content hashes)
4. Computes deltas: missing files, modified files, moves, and deletes
5. Transfers chunks (64KB, LZ4 compressed when beneficial, encrypted with random nonces)
6. Both sides update SQLite index
7. Restored files are hash-verified after write
8. File writes use atomic `.buddytmp` + `flushFile` + `moveFile` for crash safety

### NAT Traversal

- **Public TCP address** — direct connection when `announce_addr` points to a reachable public address
- **UPnP** — automatic port forwarding attempt when no explicit `announce_addr` is set
- **Relay fallback** — used when `relay_region` is set and both sides store the same buddy `pairing_code`

### Connectivity

For direct connections, forward the configured `listen_port` on your router and set `[network].announce_addr` in `~/.buddydrive/config.toml` to a public multiaddr such as `/ip4/<public-ip>/tcp/41721`.

For relay fallback, configure relay region. The stored pairing code is reused as the relay shared secret:

```bash
buddydrive config set relay-base-url https://api.buddydrive.org
buddydrive config set relay-region eu
```

## Configuration

Config file location: `~/.buddydrive/config.toml`

```toml
[buddy]
name = "purple-banana"
id = "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890"

[recovery]
enabled = true
public_key = "6J8h2qFvExampleRecoveryKey"
master_key = "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"

[network]
listen_port = 41721
announce_addr = "/ip4/203.0.113.10/tcp/41721"
relay_base_url = "https://api.buddydrive.org"
relay_region = "eu"
storage_base_path = ""
bandwidth_limit_kbps = 0

[[folders]]
id = "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479"
name = "docs"
path = "/home/user/Documents"
encrypted = true
append_only = false
folder_key = "a1b2c3d4e5f6..."
buddies = ["buddy-id-here"]

[[buddies]]
id = "buddy-id-here"
name = "cranky-wrench"
pairing_code = "ABCD-EFGH"
sync_time = "03:00"
added_at = "2026-04-10T12:00:00Z"
```

### Data Files

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `~/.buddydrive/config.toml` | Static configuration (identity, folders, buddies, recovery) |
| `~/.buddydrive/state.db` | Runtime state (SQLite): `runtime_status`, `buddy_state`, `folder_state`, `cached_buddy_addrs` |
| `~/.buddydrive/index.db` | File metadata index (SQLite) |
| `~/.buddydrive/port` | Control API port (written after daemon startup) |
| `~/.buddydrive/buddydrive.log` | Log file |

## Web GUI

The daemon serves a browser-based UI on the control port. It uses the same REST API as the CLI:

- **Localhost access**: `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/` — no authentication needed
- **LAN access**: `http://<ip>:<port>/w/<secret>/` — secret path derived from buddy UUID (first 8 chars, lowercase, no hyphens)
- Assets are embedded in the binary at compile time via `staticRead` — no external files needed
- The web GUI provides folder management, buddy pairing, settings, and log viewing

## Control API

REST API served by the daemon on `0.0.0.0:17521` by default. The actual port is written to `~/.buddydrive/port` after startup.

### Authentication

- **Localhost** (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`): No authentication required.
- **LAN**: Requests from non-localhost addresses must use a secret path prefix `/w/<secret>/`. Requests without the correct prefix receive `403 Forbidden`.

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/status` | Daemon status and identity |
| GET | `/buddies` | Buddy list with connection state |
| POST | `/buddies/pairing-code` | Generate pairing code |
| POST | `/buddies/pair` | Pair with a buddy (requires buddy ID and code) |
| DELETE | `/buddies/:id` | Remove a buddy |
| GET | `/folders` | Folder list with sync status |
| POST | `/folders` | Add folder |
| DELETE | `/folders/:name` | Remove folder |
| POST | `/sync/:folderName` | Trigger folder sync |
| GET | `/config` | Current saved configuration |
| POST | `/config` | Update selected config fields (returns `restartRequired` when needed) |
| POST | `/config/reload` | Reload configuration from disk |

### Recovery Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/recovery/setup` | Set up recovery with BIP39 mnemonic |
| POST | `/recovery/verify-word` | Verify a single word from the recovery phrase |
| POST | `/recovery/recover` | Restore config from 12-word mnemonic |
| GET | `/recovery` | Show current recovery status |
| POST | `/recovery/export` | Export recovery info |
| POST | `/recovery/sync-config` | Manually push encrypted config to the relay API |

### Error Responses

All errors follow this format:

```json
{
  "error": "Description",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE"
}
```

Common error codes: `FOLDER_NOT_FOUND`, `BUDDY_NOT_FOUND`, `INVALID_REQUEST`, `NOT_FOUND`, `INTERNAL_ERROR`, `NO_CONFIG`, `ALREADY_SETUP`, `NOT_SETUP`, `INVALID_MNEMONIC`, `MISMATCH`, `SYNC_FAILED`

### Notes

- `POST /config` returns `restartRequired` when the daemon needs a restart for changes to take effect
- The daemon also reloads config from disk automatically when `config.toml` changes (polls mtime in the discovery loop)

## Security

### Current Security Layers

| Component | Algorithm | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Direct peer transport | libp2p Noise | Encrypt direct libp2p connections |
| Folder content encryption | libsodium `crypto_secretbox` (XSalsa20-Poly1305) | Encrypt filenames and file contents stored on buddy's machine |
| Path encryption | Deterministic nonce from folderKey + path | Same path always encrypts to same ciphertext (enables move detection) |
| Chunk encryption | Random nonce per 64KB chunk | Prevents nonce reuse across file versions |
| Recovery config backup | libsodium `crypto_secretbox` | Encrypt config synced to relay |
| Pairing code | Shared secret | Match buddies, derive discovery keys, HMAC-authenticate relay records, relay fallback |
| Recovery mnemonic | Standard BIP39 (128-bit entropy + SHA-256 checksum) | Re-derive recovery metadata on a new machine; checksum catches transcription errors |
| Mnemonic-to-seed | Argon2i (`crypto_pwhash`, moderate tier) | Key derivation from mnemonic (stronger than BIP39's PBKDF2) |
| Seed-to-master key | BLAKE2b-256 | Deterministic master key from 64-byte seed |
| Public key (lookup) | BLAKE2b-256 of master key + Base58 | Relay API lookup key (not an asymmetric public key) |
| Relay API signing | Ed25519 (derived from master key) | Authenticate relay API mutations (PUT/DELETE) |
| Content hashing | BLAKE2b-256 (streaming) | File change detection, move detection, restore verification |
| Folder key derivation | BLAKE2b-256 (masterKey + folder ID) | Per-folder encryption key, stable across renames |
| Password hashing | Argon2i (`crypto_pwhash_str`) | Password storage with auto-upgrading parameters |

### Threat Model

**Protected against:**

- Network interception on direct libp2p connections (Noise transport)
- Buddy reading your files (encrypted filenames and content when folder encryption is enabled)
- Relay compromise for config backup (encrypted with recovery master key)
- Lost machine (recovery rebuilds config, sync restores files)
- File corruption (restored files are hash-verified after write)

**Not protected against:**

- Untrusted buddies when folder encryption is disabled (`encrypted = false` shares files plaintext)
- Machine compromise (malware can read files before or during sync)
- Denial of service (attacker can prevent peer connections)

### Encryption Details

When `encrypted = true` on a folder:
- **Filenames** are encrypted with deterministic nonces derived from `folderKey + "/path/" + plaintextPath`, then base64-encoded. Same path always produces the same encrypted path, enabling move detection.
- **File content** is split into 64KB chunks, each encrypted with a random 24-byte nonce prepended to the ciphertext. Random nonces prevent nonce reuse when the same file is modified across versions.
- **Folder key** is derived from `crypto_generichash(masterKey + "/folder/" + folderId)` when recovery is enabled, or a random key stored in `folder_key` in config.toml otherwise.
- Your buddy stores fully opaque encrypted blobs — they cannot read filenames or content.

When `encrypted = false`:
- Files are stored plaintext on the buddy's machine for collaboration.
- Content hashes (blake2b-256) are still used for change detection and move detection.

### Recovery Key Derivation

The full derivation chain from the 12-word mnemonic to all derived keys:

```
12-word mnemonic (standard BIP39: 128-bit entropy + SHA-256 checksum)
  │
  ▼  Argon2i (crypto_pwhash, moderate tier, 256 MB memory)
  │  salt = "mnemonic" (padded to 16 bytes)
  │  output = 64 bytes
  ▼
seed (64 bytes)
  │
  ▼  BLAKE2b-256 (crypto_generichash)
  ▼
master key (32 bytes, hex in config.toml [recovery].master_key)
  │
  ├──► BLAKE2b-256 + Base58 → publicKeyB58 (relay lookup key, not an asymmetric public key)
  │
  ├──► Ed25519 (crypto_sign_seed_keypair) → signing keypair for relay API authentication
  │    Headers: X-BD-Verify-Key, X-BD-Version, X-BD-Timestamp, X-BD-Signature
  │
  └──► BLAKE2b-256 (masterKey + "/folder/" + folderId) → folder key (per-folder encryption key)
```

BuddyDrive follows the standard BIP39 specification for mnemonic generation and validation (128-bit entropy + SHA-256 checksum), tested against official BIP39 test vectors. The key derivation step diverges from BIP39 by using Argon2i instead of PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 — this provides stronger resistance to GPU and ASIC attacks. The consequence is that other BIP39-compatible tools cannot derive the same master key from a BuddyDrive mnemonic.

## Relay Server

The relay enables NAT traversal and encrypted config storage. See [relay/README.md](../relay/README.md) for full details.

### Public Relay

- **TCP relay**: `relay-eu.buddydrive.org:19447` (for NAT traversal)
- **API**: `https://api.buddydrive.org` (for discovery, encrypted config storage, and relay lists)
- **Region**: Frankfurt (fra)

### Self-Hosted Relay

```bash
# TCP relay only (default port 41722)
./buddydrive-relay

# With HTTP API support (requires TIDB_CONNECTION_STRING)
export TIDB_CONNECTION_STRING="mysql://user:pass@host:4000/buddydrive"
./buddydrive-relay 41722 8080
```

Docker and Koyeb deployment options are documented in [relay/README.md](../relay/README.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Daemon won't start

```bash
buddydrive logs
buddydrive config
```

### Can't connect to buddy

1. Both peers need internet access
2. Both peers need `buddydrive start` running
3. Check stored buddies with `buddydrive list-buddies`
4. For direct mode, verify port forwarding and `announce_addr`
5. For relay mode, verify `relay-region`, `relay-base-url`, and matching pairing codes

### Files not syncing

1. Check daemon logs with `buddydrive logs`
2. Check folder configuration with `buddydrive list-folders`
3. `buddydrive status` does not show live connection state yet
4. Missing files are restored through normal sync after connectivity returns

### Address already in use

Set different `listen_port` values in each instance's config, and use different `--port` values when starting the daemons.

### `buddydrive status` shows buddies as offline

Expected. The CLI status command reads configured state, but does not yet report live daemon connectivity.
