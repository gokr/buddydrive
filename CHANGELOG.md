and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Core daemon and CLI built on libp2p: `init`, `add-folder`, `add-buddy` with
  pairing codes, `start`, and related subcommands, backed by TOML configuration.
- Buddy pairing protocol and encrypted file sync infrastructure, with
  deterministic initiator selection, UPnP attempts, and relay fallback when
  direct connections fail.
- Encrypted backup of synced files (filenames and content) on the buddy's
  machine, using deterministic path encryption for move detection and random
  content nonces.
- Content-hashed sync with streaming Blake2b hashing, move and delete
  detection, and re-sync of files that exist on the buddy but are missing
  locally (verified by hash).
- Recovery system: 12-word BIP39 recovery phrase with SHA-256 checksum
  (validated against the official BIP39 test vectors), Ed25519 master key
  derived from the mnemonic via Argon2i, and encrypted config sync to the
  relay and buddies. New CLI commands: `setup-recovery`, `recover`,
  `sync-config`, `export-recovery`.
- Crash-safe file receiving: incoming files are written to `.buddytmp` temp
  files, fsynced, then atomically renamed; leftover temp files are cleaned up
  on daemon startup.
- Folder policies: append-only mode that prevents remote overwrites of
  existing local files (including re-sync when the local hash differs from
  the remote, catching corrupt or partial files), and a per-folder encryption
  flag.
- Per-buddy sync scheduling; incoming connections are always accepted.
- Web-based admin GUI served from the daemon's control server, with
  LAN secret-path authentication and runtime config reload.
- GTK4 desktop GUI (Linux) for monitoring and configuration.
- Daemon control server with SQLite state and a REST API, including recovery
  and restore endpoints, plus a dedicated storage base path for incoming
  buddy data.
- Testament-based test suite with unit and integration tests covering crypto,
  pairing, discovery, sync, crash safety, and relay/KV integration.
- Relay server KV-store API with HMAC-authenticated discovery records,
  a `/relays/<region>` endpoint for per-region TCP relay addresses, packaged
  EU CIDR snapshots, and abuse hardening.

### Changed

- Peer discovery now uses the relay KV store instead of KadDHT: buddy
  addresses are published and looked up via pairing-code-derived,
  HMAC-authenticated records with a 6-hour TTL, and last-known addresses are
  cached in `state.db` for graceful degradation. The discovery interval moved
  from 15 seconds to 10 minutes.
- The relay server was moved to the separate
  [buddydrive-relay](https://github.com/gokr/buddydrive-relay) repository and
  removed from this one.
- `relayBaseUrl` was renamed to `apiBaseUrl` throughout the config, CLI, and
  API, with `https://api.buddydrive.org` as the default when unset.
- The relay TCP port changed from 19447 to 41722.
- Key derivation was upgraded from the Argon2i interactive tier (64 MB) to the
  moderate tier (256 MB) for stronger GPU/ASIC resistance.
- A single master key derived from the recovery phrase is now used for all
  folders, replacing per-folder keys.
- Documentation was consolidated under `docs/`, the website is deployed via
  GitHub Pages, and Debian packaging gained man pages, tmpfiles configuration,
  and a postinst script.
- Integration tests are now self-contained and fail loudly: an in-process TCP
  relay and a KV API stub (which verifies Ed25519 signatures for real) replace
  the network tests that previously turned failures into skips, and each test
  process gets an isolated config and index directory. New coverage includes
  bidirectional sync in one session, deletion propagation, append-only folders
  ignoring a remote delete, and mismatched pairing codes not meeting on the
  relay.
- Added `docs/architecture.md` describing the sync session and sync protocol.

### Fixed

- Double-nonce bug in `encrypt`/`decrypt` that produced a corrupted
  nonce-prefixed ciphertext and broke decryption.
- Crash when mounting the pairing protocol handler on an already-started
  libp2p switch.
- GTK settings dialog not showing saved values, and header overflow on mobile.
- Daemon startup error handling, and a case where a file was moved even though
  `flushAndClose` had failed.
- DNS relay resolution: `/dns4/` and `/dns6/` multiaddresses are now resolved
  to IP addresses before dialing, as the raw TCP transport requires wire
  addresses.
- macOS build and runtime: `libsodium.dylib` loading, the missing
  `liblz4-dev` dependency, and the Homebrew `/opt/homebrew/lib` link path.
- Sync no longer deletes a file that exists on only one side. A remote path is
  now deleted only when the index shows the folder previously held it;
  anything never seen locally stays in the projection and is pulled. Index rows
  for vanished files are kept until deletions have propagated, so a failed
  session can at worst resurrect a deleted file rather than lose a live one.
- Deletion propagation now refuses to delete from append-only folders, which
  previously only blocked remote overwrites.
- Sync sessions end with an explicit session-end handshake, so neither peer
  closes the connection while the buddy still has data in flight. Over the
  public relay this previously truncated the stream and reported a failed sync
  even though both sides had transferred everything.
- Recovery now distinguishes "no config is stored for this recovery phrase"
  from "the config service could not be reached", rather than reporting every
  non-200 response as a missing backup.
