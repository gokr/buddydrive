## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Core daemon and CLI built on libp2p: `init`, `add-folder`, `add-buddy` with
  pairing codes, `start`, and related subcommands, backed by TOML configuration.
- Buddy pairing protocol and encrypted file sync infrastructure, with
  deterministic initiator selection, UPnP attempts, and relay fallback when
  direct connections fail.
- Encrypted backup of synced files (filenames and content) on the buddy's
  machine, using deterministic path encryption for move detection and random
  content nonces.
- Content-hashed sync with streaming Blake2b hashing, move and delete
  detection, and re-sync of files that exist on the buddy but are missing
  locally (verified by hash).
- Recovery system: 12-word BIP39 recovery phrase with SHA-256 checksum
  (validated against the official BIP39 test vectors), Ed25519 master key
  derived from the mnemonic via Argon2i, and encrypted config sync to the
  relay and buddies. New CLI commands: `setup-recovery`, `recover`,
  `sync-config`, `export-recovery`.
- Crash-safe file receiving: incoming files are written to `.buddytmp` temp
  files, fsynced, then atomically renamed; leftover temp files are cleaned up
  on daemon startup.
- Folder policies: append-only mode that prevents remote overwrites of
  existing local files (including re-sync when the local hash differs from
  the remote, catching corrupt or partial files), and a per-folder encryption
  flag.
- Per-buddy sync scheduling; incoming connections are always accepted.
- Web-based admin GUI served from the daemon's control server, with
  LAN secret-path authentication and runtime config reload.
- GTK4 desktop GUI (Linux) for monitoring and configuration.
- Daemon control server with SQLite state and a REST API, including recovery
  and restore endpoints, plus a dedicated storage base path for incoming
  buddy data.
- Testament-based test suite with unit and integration tests covering crypto,
  pairing, discovery, sync, crash safety, and relay/KV integration.
- Relay server KV-store API with HMAC-authenticated discovery records,
  a `/relays/<region>` endpoint for per-region TCP relay addresses, packaged
  EU CIDR snapshots, and abuse hardening.

### Changed

- Peer discovery now uses the relay KV store instead of KadDHT: buddy
  addresses are published and looked up via pairing-code-derived,
  HMAC-authenticated records with a 6-hour TTL, and last-known addresses are
  cached in `state.db` for graceful degradation. The discovery interval moved
  from 15 seconds to 10 minutes.
- The relay server was moved to the separate
  [buddydrive-relay](https://github.com/gokr/buddydrive-relay) repository and
  removed from this one.
- `relayBaseUrl` was renamed to `apiBaseUrl` throughout the config, CLI, and
  API, with `https://api.buddydrive.org` as the default when unset.
- The relay TCP port changed from 19447 to 41722.
- Key derivation was upgraded from the Argon2i interactive tier (64 MB) to the
  moderate tier (256 MB) for stronger GPU/ASIC resistance.
- A single master key derived from the recovery phrase is now used for all
  folders, replacing per-folder keys.
- Documentation was consolidated under `docs/`, the website is deployed via
  GitHub Pages, and Debian packaging gained man pages, tmpfiles configuration,
  and a postinst script.
- Integration tests are now self-contained and fail loudly: the
  skip/except fallbacks that turned real failures into passes were removed,
  and the suite gained an in-process TCP relay stand-in (resolved by region
  `local`), a KV API stub that verifies Ed25519 signatures, and isolated
  per-process config/index directories. New coverage includes bidirectional
  sync in one session, deletion propagation, append-only ignoring a remote
  delete, and mismatched pairing codes not meeting on the relay.

### Fixed

- Double-nonce bug in `encrypt`/`decrypt` that produced a corrupted
  nonce-prefixed ciphertext and broke decryption.
- Crash when mounting the pairing protocol handler on an already-started
  libp2p switch.
- GTK settings dialog not showing saved values, and header overflow on mobile.
- Daemon startup error handling, and a case where a file was moved even though
  `flushAndClose` had failed.
- DNS relay resolution: `/dns4/` and `/dns6/` multiaddresses are now resolved
  to IP addresses before dialing, as the raw TCP transport requires wire
  addresses.
- macOS build and runtime: `libsodium.dylib` loading and the missing
  `liblz4-dev` dependency.
- Sync no longer deletes files that exist on only one side. A remote path is
  deleted only when the index shows the local side previously held it;
  anything never seen locally is pulled instead. Index rows for files that
  disappeared from disk are now retained, with pruning moved to
  `pruneIndexOfMissingFiles` after deletions have propagated, so the worst
  case for a failed session is a deleted file reappearing rather than a live
  file being lost. `deleteLocalFile` also now refuses on append-only folders,
  which previously only blocked overwrites.
- Sync sessions end with an explicit `msgSessionEnd` exchange so a relay
  cannot tear down the connection while a peer still has data coming and
  truncate the final stream. The peer that speaks first in the delta phase
  sends the marker and waits for the buddy's; the other answers and then
  waits for the buddy to hang up. `msgSessionEnd` is appended to `MessageKind`
  so existing kind byte values are unchanged, and older buddies incur only a
  timeout.
- Recovery now distinguishes a missing config from an unreachable config
  service. `fetchConfigFromRelayChecked` reports `fcFound`, `fcMissing`, or
  `fcUnavailable`, and `attemptRecovery` tells the user whether no config is
  stored for the phrase or the service could not be reached (in which case the
  config may still be stored).
