## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Core daemon and CLI built on libp2p: `init`, `add-folder`, `add-buddy` with
  pairing codes, `start`, and related subcommands, backed by TOML configuration.
- Buddy pairing protocol and encrypted file sync infrastructure, with
  deterministic initiator selection, UPnP attempts, and relay fallback when
  direct connections fail.
- Encrypted backup of synced files (filenames and content) on the buddy's
  machine, using deterministic path encryption for move detection and random
  content nonces.
- Content-hashed sync with streaming Blake2b hashing, move and delete
  detection, and re-sync of files that exist on the buddy but are missing
  locally (verified by hash).
- Recovery system: 12-word BIP39 recovery phrase with SHA-256 checksum
  (validated against the official BIP39 test vectors), Ed25519 master key
  derived from the mnemonic via Argon2i, and encrypted config sync to the
  relay and buddies. New CLI commands: `setup-recovery`, `recover`,
  `sync-config`, `export-recovery`.
- Crash-safe file receiving: incoming files are written to `.buddytmp` temp
  files, fsynced, then atomically renamed; leftover temp files are cleaned up
  on daemon startup.
- Folder policies: append-only mode that prevents remote overwrites of
  existing local files (including re-sync when the local hash differs from
  the remote, catching corrupt or partial files), and a per-folder encryption
  flag.
- Per-buddy sync scheduling; incoming connections are always accepted.
- Web-based admin GUI served from the daemon's control server, with
  LAN secret-path authentication and runtime config reload.
- GTK4 desktop GUI (Linux) for monitoring and configuration.
- Daemon control server with SQLite state and a REST API, including recovery
  and restore endpoints, plus a dedicated storage base path for incoming
  buddy data.
- Testament-based test suite with unit and integration tests covering crypto,
  pairing, discovery, sync, crash safety, and relay/KV integration.
- Relay server KV-store API with HMAC-authenticated discovery records,
  a `/relays/<region>` endpoint for per-region TCP relay addresses, packaged
  EU CIDR snapshots, and abuse hardening.

### Changed

- Peer discovery now uses the relay KV store instead of KadDHT: buddy
  addresses are published and looked up via pairing-code-derived,
  HMAC-authenticated records with a 6-hour TTL, and last-known addresses are
  cached in `state.db` for graceful degradation. The discovery interval moved
  from 15 seconds to 10 minutes.
- The relay server was moved to the separate
  [buddydrive-relay](https://github.com/gokr/buddydrive-relay) repository and
  removed from this one.
- `relayBaseUrl` was renamed to `apiBaseUrl` throughout the config, CLI, and
  API, with `https://api.buddydrive.org` as the default when unset.
- The relay TCP port changed from 19447 to 41722.
- Key derivation was upgraded from the Argon2i interactive tier (64 MB) to the
  moderate tier (256 MB) for stronger GPU/ASIC resistance.
- A single master key derived from the recovery phrase is now used for all
  folders, replacing per-folder keys.
- Documentation was consolidated under `docs/`, the website is deployed via
  GitHub Pages, and Debian packaging gained man pages, tmpfiles configuration,
  and a postinst script.
- Network integration tests are now self-contained and fail loudly. They had
  been silently skipping real failures (reported as skips, which testament
  counts as passes, plus a `|| true` on the test task), and the relay tests
  had been dead since the relay server moved to its own repository. Tests now
  use an in-process TCP relay stand-in, a KV API stand-in that verifies
  Ed25519 signatures, and an isolated config/index directory per test process.

### Fixed

- Double-nonce bug in `encrypt`/`decrypt` that produced a corrupted
  nonce-prefixed ciphertext and broke decryption.
- Crash when mounting the pairing protocol handler on an already-started
  libp2p switch.
- GTK settings dialog not showing saved values, and header overflow on mobile.
- Daemon startup error handling, and a case where a file was moved even though
  `flushAndClose` had failed.
- DNS relay resolution: `/dns4/` and `/dns6/` multiaddresses are now resolved
  to IP addresses before dialing, as the raw TCP transport requires wire
  addresses.
- macOS build and runtime: `libsodium.dylib` loading and the missing
  `liblz4-dev` dependency.
- Sync no longer deletes files that exist on only one side. A remote path is
  now deleted only when the index shows the file was held locally before;
  paths never seen are pulled instead of removed, so restoring onto a machine
  without its data fetches the buddy's copy rather than wiping it. Index rows
  for missing files are retained until deletions have been propagated, so a
  failed session leaves a deleted file recoverable rather than a live file
  gone. `deleteLocalFile` also refuses on append-only folders, which
  previously only blocked overwrites.
- Sync sessions now end with an explicit session-end exchange, ordered by the
  same UUID comparison used for the delta phases. Previously the peer that
  finished first closed the connection while the other was still awaiting the
  final file ack and sync-done; the public relay then dropped the buffered
  remainder, so the slower side saw a truncated stream and reported a failed
  sync even though everything had transferred.
- Recovery now distinguishes a missing config from an unreachable service.
  `fetchConfigFromRelayChecked` reports found/missing/unavailable, and
  `attemptRecovery` reports accordingly, so a user rebuilding a lost machine
  is no longer told their backup does not exist when the config service merely
  could not answer, and is advised to retry instead.
